    "\n",
    "1. Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "Descriptive statistics involves the collection, organization, summarization, and presentation of data in a way that helps to understand and interpret the data. Examples of descriptive statistics include measures of central tendency (such as mean, median, and mode), measures of variability (such as range, variance, and standard deviation), and graphical representations (such as histograms and box plots). Descriptive statistics can be used in various fields to summarize and describe the characteristics of a dataset. For example, a marketing firm might use descriptive statistics to analyze sales data to understand customer behavior and trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "Inferential statistics involves using sample data to make inferences or draw conclusions about a larger population. This type of statistics is used to test hypotheses, estimate population parameters, and make predictions. Examples of inferential statistics include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis. Inferential statistics can be used in various fields to make decisions and draw conclusions based on sample data. For example, a pharmaceutical company might use inferential statistics to test the effectiveness of a new drug by comparing the results of a clinical trial to a control group.\n",
